# Laravel People

Laravel people is a small web-app project I am using as a test of the Laravel framework. It doesn't contain much but it made me realise how awesome Laravel actually is.

## Functionalities

On this website, you can play with a contact list by :
- adding new people;
- update people informations;
- deleting people.

## Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability or a bug within the website, feel free to post an issue. This would help me understanding Laravel better :)
